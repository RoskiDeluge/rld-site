As a practicing dev, I'm constantly on the lookout for good webinars and tutorials by other devs. One trait that I've noticed is common to the best devs is confidence. But this is not your typical ted-talky blustery confidence, but a quieter one that shows up during moments that can induce a stage fright just as terrifying, I'm talking about debugging during a live webinar.

Having felt the rush of adrenaline and outright hopelessness of debugging on a deadline, I can empathize somewhat with the particular feelings they may have in those moments. But more interesting for me is how they overcome those feelings and stick with a process that in almost all cases results in them finding the bug and fixing the problem. 

When I think about confidence, I usually imagine a person that is also calm and collected under fire and is able to execute without collapsing in frustration. But the part that I don't see is the many moments where they've had to cycle through the range of emotions that bring them to the brink of quiting, but they somehow keep going. I like to imagine each of these moments as a flexing that helps to strenghthen the confidence muscle.
