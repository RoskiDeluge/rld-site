# Value/Cost

**Source: Matt Horiuchi, Director User Acquisition at Calm**

The key equation is: 

LTV/CAC (Lifetime Value/Customer Acquisition Costs) = A percentage that represents value over cost. 

*** NOTE:  Without an LTV/CAC model we have no idea how much we can pay for a customer, and having the attribution in place tells us how much we're paying per customer. *** 

**Lifetime Value** of a customer is how much value(money) we can expect from a customer throughout his/her lifetime with us. (A caveat: this information is ***not*** available on day one. As we engage in customer discovery/development, we determine the value of our customers).

**Customer Acquisition Costs** is how much it costs us to acquire a customer, which means that we have in place attributions to track that customer. (Same caveat as above: we fine tune our attribution as we engage in customer discovery/development). 

# Link attribution

Most of the attribution we'll be doing will be link attribution. Any platform that sells digital ad space uses a link attribution system. How? By using a url which serves as a link to the landing page while also including customizable campaign specific attributes (utm source, etc). 

At a minimum when we start to market online (facebook/instagram), we should create different landing pages/lead forms per media source.  

# Market-Product-Channel-Model fit

You need to master all of the above fits to have a successful company that grows. Getting one of the fits wrong will create a domino affect that affects all the other fits.

**Market**: who are you selling to? The size of the market determines how big your company can grow. Who are the people? What are the challenges? Do they know they have those challenges? Do they care about those challenges?

**Product**: What you're selling.

**Channel**: Where are you selling the product? In other words, how are you getting it to the market?

You can't change the channel, you can only optimize your product to better fit the channel. - Brian Balfour

**Model**: How much are you selling it for? Low cost/high volume model? Or high volume/low cost model? This will affect the channel you chose.

# If you have fit, then how do you grow?

Growth is a funnel, not a stage. Traditionally, marketing stops at acquisition, whereas growth goes through the entire funnel. 

Funnel: Acquisition >> Activation >> Retention >> Revenue >> Referral

Acquisition: all about product-channel fit. Low cost/High volume: search ads; High cost/low volume: high touch sales.

Activation: Shrinking time to value, or how to get people to the "aha" moment faster.

Retention: Keep users coming back. If they're not in the product, find ways outside of the product to bring them back in. 

Revenue: $

Referral: Do the customers tell others about your product? 

## Every step of the funnel is important, not just the top of the funnel.

Important to prioritize projects by ROI. So if you're at a startup with limited resources, you need to prioritize learning over everything. 

ROI = Impact * Cost * Risk 

Impact isn't just moving the numbers, it's also how much you're going to learn. The earlier stage you're in, the more important the learning is. What's important here is how quickly can we re-orient ourselves from the mis-assumptions we've made onto the right path? What's your hypothesis? How will you confirm or invalidate it?

# North Star Metric

A north star metric is a metric that is indicative of the health and growth of your company that can't be gamified and can't be influenced by spammy growth tactics. 

The north star metric has to be found, measured, monitored and used to align the entire company around it. 

Question from a person in the audience with a SaaS project management tool for homeowners and contractors: How can I define my NSM with a product that has difficult to track retention because of the lag between using the product and paying for it? 

Are there a set of "kick the tire" activities that are highly correlated with becoming a paying customer of your product, before they're actually paying for your product? This is found by doing a bunch of number crunching and regression analysis.
