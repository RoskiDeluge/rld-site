The other day my partner and I were talking about deception. She's a writer and is aware of how we can use the same words to say different things. Take, for instance, the Subway slogan "baked fresh daily." My assumption was that the bread was baked earlier that day and is therefore as fresh as a few hours. But this is wrong. According to a friend of her's that worked in Subway, they don't use the bread that is baked fresh to make sandwiches. Now it is strictly true that the bread is baked fresh everyday, but you are not eating that bread, you are actually eating the bread that _was_ baked fresh yesterday or the day before. This is an example of what Jonathan Webber referred to as a true assertion with a bullshit implicature that is characteristic of much advertising.
