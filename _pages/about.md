![Roberto Delgado Profile Picture](/img/rd_profile.png)

I'm a full stack web developer based in Honolulu, HI. I started learning about the Web in 1995 when I typed the URL for the Zapatistas in Netscape to learn about their fight in Chiapas. As a Lambda School student, I've gained experience building single page apps with React frontend / Node REST API backend. As an independent consultant, I've helped my clients with web strategy, content marketing flows, and digital production.
