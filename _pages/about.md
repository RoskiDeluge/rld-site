![Roberto Delgado Profile Picture](/img/rd_profile.png)

I'm a web technologist and generalist based in Honolulu, HI. I started learning about the Web in 1995 when I typed the URL for the Zapatista's website in Netscape to learn about their fight in Chiapas. As an independent consultant, I've helped my clients with web strategy, design/development, and digital production.
