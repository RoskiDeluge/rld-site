Delgado - Panoramas Isleños" /></p><p>The gold rush era represented many things. One of its representations is a turbulent time when the fate of whole cultures was being decided and astronomical fortunes were being made. Amid this turmoil, another revolution no less important was unfolding: the perfect representation of the land through photography. The lands of California were the first to be faithfully captured by the new technology.</p><p>The American nation began to congeal through the ability of these landscape photographs to fix and provide a document for things that had only been imagined. The early landscape photographers had a dual mission, to develop the medium aesthetically and to make the land legible and thus conquerable. In other words, to turn land into landscapes.</p><p>Gold rush era California was the perfect place for landscape photography because, above all, it afforded the nation with a vision of themselves as the first man, living out his manifest destiny by claiming and naming. Photography was the perfect handmaiden for this process of imaginative bootstrapping. The California photographers (hardy, resourceful, and technically astute) could make people see this vision (Solnit 2004).</p><p>Fast forward to today and consider this group of landscape photographs of Puerto Rico. Here we see a vision of a place that has largesse, opulence and ritmo. There’s also technical homage to the tradition of using clouds as expressive elements in the compositions. But, arguably, what is best about these photographs is their joint cleansing effect realized through an invitation to really see this place again, but from a different vantage point. They testify to a desire to turn this landscape into land again, which, admittedly, may be quixotic, but here in Puerto Rico we know a thing or two about crazed Spaniards fighting against windmills.</p><p>Reading: <br /> Rebecca Solnit, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/River-Shadows-Eadweard-Muybridge-Technological/dp/0142004103">River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West</a></p><p>Photo: <br /> Jorge L.
